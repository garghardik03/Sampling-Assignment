# **Sampling**
Analyzing different sampling techniques
This project compares the performance of 5 different machine learning models on 5 different sampling techniques for imbalanced datasets.

SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is used to make dataset balanced dataset

## The sampling techniques used in this project are:
### Probability Sampling:
1. Simple-Random Sampling
2. Systematic Sampling
3. Cluster Sampling
4. Stratified Sampling

### Non-Probability Sampling:
Convenience Sampling

## The machine learning models used in this project are:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Naive Bayes Classifier

## The dataset used in this project is:
[Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnjulaMehto/Sampling_Assignment/main/Creditcard_data.csv)

## The technique used to check the goodness of the samples is:
1. Shapiro-Wilk Test
